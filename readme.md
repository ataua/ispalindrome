# Is this expression a palindrome?

Palindromes are expressions thar read the same from left to right and from 
right to left. Some examples are:  
- "Socorram-me subi no onibus em Marrocos"
- "Madam, I'm Adam" 
- "Never odd or even"  

Since we are interested only in how the text sounds, white spaces and 
capitalization are meaningless. In Portuguese, we have accented letters like 'ã'
and 'ç', which differ form the unaccented ones. For the scope of this project,
it was not created a function which would convert accented to unaccented letters,
so word like 'aço' and 'maçã' should be written 'aco' and 'maca' correspondly.
